Explanation of the files

- python_caller.py and web_scrapper_selenium.py are the scripts that are used to get the Weather underground data, the results of which are in the csv folder. And that is then merged into the merged.csv folder.
- The meteo_scrap folder is the folder pertaining to the acquiring of the data of the weather from the French Gov website. The result is in result.csv. Since the original base data is too big, it is omitted from the zip.
- The models.zip file is where the models are done.
